<br>

[Jacques Lacan‚Äôs]() **Graph of Desire** (French: *graphe du d√©sir*) is a central conceptual tool in his psychoanalytic theory. It is a **topological model** that graphically represents the intricate structure of human desire and subjectivity as mediated by language and the Symbolic Other . Developed across his seminars, notably in *Les formations de l'inconscient* (1957-58) and *The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire* (1960), the graph illustrates the "logical moments" of the speaking subject's formation, rather than a chronological development .

## [Overview]():

This repository presents a detailed and interdisciplinary exploration of **Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory**, with a focus on the **Graph of Desire** and associated *mathemes*‚Äîformal symbolic and topological models of unconscious subjectivity and desire.

By bridging psychoanalysis, formal mathematics, and computational modeling (including the Free Energy Principle), it provides theory, visualization, and simulation tools for researchers in **Humanistic AI, cognitive science, linguistics**, and psychoanalysis.


<br>

## [Key Concepts]()

- **Graph of Desire:** A structure showing how unconscious desire traverses and is shaped by language (the signifying chain), symbolic law (the Other), and internal division (the barred subject).
- **Mathemes:** Lacan‚Äôs formal logic of key psychoanalytic notions, like sexuation, subjectivity, and the structure of desire.
- **Symbolic Formalization:** Use of logic, topology, and graph theory to model the dynamics of the unconscious.

<br>


## [Recent Computational Formalization]()

A recent study ([Heins et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1574650)) **formalizes Lacanian psychoanalysis using the Free Energy Principle (FEP)**, providing computational simulations embodying concepts such as desire, the Other, and their dynamic relations.

<br>

### ‚ö°Ô∏è [Highlights]()

<br>

- Models the Real, Symbolic, and Imaginary (RSI) orders as interacting autonomous systems minimizing free energy.
- Simulates structures like the **Borromean knot**, **dyadic synchronization** (desire as metaphorical convergence), and **triadic collective behaviors** (the Other as emergent).
- Demonstrates that the subject‚Äôs desire is ultimately the *desire of the Other*, and that ‚Äúthe Other does not exist‚Äù; mirroring G√∂delian incompleteness.

<br>

***This work connects psychoanalysis, computational neuroscience, and [Humanistic AI](), supporting the rigorous modeling of subjectivity and unconscious processes.***

## [Limits of Formalization: G√∂del‚Äôs Incompleteness Theorems and Lacanian Theory]()

<br>

This repository not only formalizes Lacan‚Äôs psychoanalytic theory, but also acknowledges the [**limits of all formal systems**]() as demonstrated by [**G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness theorems**](). No [axiomatic model‚Äîwhether]()  in mathematics, logic, or psychoanalysis‚Äîcan be both complete and consistent. There will always be aspects of [reality]() (the ‚Äúreal‚Äù in Lacanian terms) that escape symbolic capture.

<br>

This parallel reinforces Lacan's insight that the unconscious and human subjectivity remain fundamentally open and incomplete, echoing the [**lack in the Other**]()  and the inherent boundaries of any modeling approach‚Äîcritical for anyone working in [Humanistic AI]().

<br>


Below, I develop this parallel including the most relevant mathematical formalizations in LaTeX and its relation to Lacanian theory.

<br>


### 1. [G√∂del and the limitations of formalization]():

G√∂del proved that **no sufficiently powerful formal system** (such as basic arithmetic) can be both *complete* and *consistent*.


<br><br>


### - [**First Incompleteness Theorem**](): There exist true propositions in arithmetic that can never be proven within the formal system itself.

Mathematically, given a consistent and recursively enumerable formal system $F\$ that includes arithmetic, there is a statement $G_F\$ (called the G√∂del sentence) such that:

<br>

$$
F \not\vdash G_F \quad \text{and} \quad F \not\vdash \neg G_F
$$

<br>

[That is](): neither $G_F\$ nor its negation can be proven in $F\$, rendering $F\$ incomplete.


<br><br>

### <p align="center">  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ãÖ‚ãÜ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ãÜ‚ãÖ[‚úÆ]()‚ãÖ‚ãÜ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ãÖ‚ãÜ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 

<br><br>


### - [**Second Incompleteness Theorem**](): The system $F\$ cannot prove its own consistency, formally expressed as:

<br>

$$
F \not\vdash \mathrm{Consis}(F)
$$

<br>

[Where](): $\mathrm{Consis}(F)$ is a formula within the system expressing the ‚Äúnon-contradiction‚Äù of $F\$.


<br><br>


### 2. [Conceptual translation to Lacan and psychoanalysis]():


<br>

The psychoanalytic subject‚Äôs experience, according to Lacan, is marked by a structure of *lack*, which he calls the **‚ÄúReal‚Äù**; a domain resisting full symbolization by the **‚ÄúSymbolic‚Äù** (language and its rules). This Real is precisely what escapes any complete and closed formalization.

<br>

- The **‚ÄúOther‚Äù** (in Lacanian theory, the symbolic instance) contains a fundamental *lack*, a kind of **structural incompleteness** that prevents the subject from being perfectly represented or captured in totality.

- Just as G√∂del shows that every formal system has inevitable limits (undemonstrable truths), the Lacanian subject experiences their unconscious as marked by an ‚Äúexcess‚Äù beyond the symbolic, not fully representable or accessible.

 
<br><br>


### 3.[ Formalism and the subject's experience ‚Äî mathematical/psychoanalytic parallel]():

<br>

We can express analogously the paradox of subject and formal system as follows:

<br>

- Let $F\$ be a formal system representing the Symbolic (language, culture, law).

- The sentence $G_F\$, true but unprovable in $F\$, corresponds to the Lacanian Real;  that which is always beyond the reach of the symbolic, not captured by language.


<br><br>


### 4. [Note on the syntactic construction of the G√∂del sentence]():

The G√∂del sentence  $G_F\$ is constructed to indirectly refer to itself via arithmetic on natural numbers, employing a method of arithmetization of syntax (G√∂del numbering), which enables encoding meta-mathematical statements inside the formal system itself.


<br>


## [Lacan‚Äôs Graph of Desire: A Comprehensive Visual Guide]()

<br>

Jacques Lacan's **Graph of Desire** (or Graph of the Analytic Act) is a formal, schematic diagram he developed to represent the complex structures of subjectivity, desire, and the unconscious in psychoanalysis. It elaborates how desire functions in relation to the subject and language, revealing the dynamics of the split or barred subject (*$*) as situated within the Symbolic order.

<br>

### ‚û† [Key points about Lacan's Graph of Desire include]():

<br>

- [It is a **"flattened" representation** of the crossing between two pathways](): the **signifying chain** (sequence of linguistic signs with meaning) and the **vector of desire** (the will or volition of the subject, expressed metaphorically and timelessly). The graph thus captures how desire operates amidst language and symbolic limitation.

<br>

- [The barred subject (*$*) is central](): it designates the split or conflicted human subject formed in the process of individuation beginning in infancy through the loss of symbiotic relations (with the mother), mediated by language. Desire is thus marked by a fundamental **lack** or absence never fully satisfied, only substituted by other objects.

<br>

- [The points where the vector of desire and the signifying chain cross](), represent moments of **Freudian double inscription**, where conscious and unconscious meanings coincide and constrain each other, reflecting the structure of psychoanalytic experience.

<br>

- [Lacan used several versions or steps of these graphs](), beginning from a basic "elementary cell," progressively elaborating the formation of the ego ideal and the subject's positioning relative to the Other and the Law (notably, the ‚ÄúName-of-the-Father‚Äù as symbolic prohibition).

<br>

- The graph illustrates how **desire is always the desire of the Other**, meaning the subject seeks desire validated or recognized by the symbolic Other‚Äîthe social or linguistic Otherness that shapes subjectivity.

<br>

- [Lacan describes the subject]() not as a fixed, autonomous individual but as constituted through language and desire, with the ego as an object rather than true subjectivity.
  
<br>

In sum, Lacan‚Äôs Graph of Desire is a conceptual and formal tool to map the relations between language, desire, the split subject, and the unconscious in psychoanalytic theory. It is often studied to understand how desire eludes fulfillment while structuring human subjectivity within symbolic and imaginary dimensions.

<br>


### [Lacan constructs the complete graph in **four stages**](), each building in complexity to illustrate the full structure. These stages are pedagogical devices, as the graph always exists as a whole.


<br><br>

###  1.[ The Elementary Cell]()

The **Elementary Cell** is the foundational stage of the Graph of Desire. It depicts the fundamental intersection of the **signifying chain** and the **vector of the subject's intentionality** (or desire).


<br>

- The **horizontal line** represents the **diachronic signifying chain** ($S \to S'$), which moves from a linguistic sign to a signification or meaning. It has duration.

- The **horseshoe-shaped line** represents the **vector of the subject's desire** ($\$$), which is expressed metaphorically and has no duration. This vector starts from the split or barred subject ($\$$).

The **double intersection** of these two lines illustrates the **nature of retroaction (or *point de capiton*)**, where meaning is determined retroactively .

<br>

    /           \
   /             \
S ------------------ S' Signifying Chain
```


<br><br><br>



###  2. [The Elementary Cell with the Locus of the Other]() (A)


<br>

In the second stage, Lacan introduces the **locus of the Other (A)**, representing the big Other, the symbolic order, or the "treasure trove" of signifiers. This stage illustrates how the message, located at $s(A)$, is retroactively punctuated and given meaning by the Other (A).

<br>

- The **prelinguistic mythical subject of pure need** (represented by a triangle, or a rudimentary subject prior to language) must pass through the "defiles of the signifier".

- This process produces the **divided subject ($\$$)**, which is the result of entering the Symbolic order.

<br>

    /           \
   /----(s(A))---\
S ---------A------- S' Signifying Chain
```


<br><br><br>



### 3. [The Graph of Demand and Desire]()

<br>

This stage introduces the concepts of **demand** and **desire**, distinguishing them within the graph. It often resembles a question mark, as desire, for Lacan, is fundamentally a question.

<br>

- [It features two new symbols]():
    
    - The **lozenge ($\diamond$)**, or *poin√ßon*, which indicates a relation of envelopment, conjunction, or disjunction between two elements. Lacan describes it as "soldering together" the mathematical symbols for "less than" and "more than".
    
    - A lowercase **$d$** which indicates **desire**.
 
  <br>

- This stage highlights how **demand** (often represented as uppercase D or as the subject's relation to demand, `(D)` ) and **desire** are interconnected and shaped by the Other. Desire, for Lacan, is always "the desire of the Other" ($A \diamond d$).



<br>

[**Visual Representation (adding Demand and Desire)**]():

<br>



```
      _________ Vector of Subject's Intentionality ($)
     /         \
    /           \

S ---------A------- S' Signifying Chain
        /   \
       /     \
      d ----- D (Demand)
```


<br><br><br>

### 4. [The Complete Graph]()

<br>

The **Complete Graph** is a complex topological representation with **two signifying chains** and multiple intersecting vectors. It integrates all the elements from the previous stages and adds new dimensions related to the **unconscious**, **enunciation**, **jouissance**, and the **drive**.

<br>

- The **lower chain** (from signifier to voice) represents the **conscious signifying chain**, the **level of the statement**.

- The **upper chain** (from jouissance to castration) represents the **signifying chain in the unconscious**, the **level of the enunciation**.


The structure is duplicated, with the upper part of the graph mirroring the lower part's structure [^1]. This complete graph forms a series of interacting "systems" (both inter-subjective and intra-subjective), where elements can participate in multiple systems simultaneously.

<br>


[**Key elements in the Complete Graph:**]():

- **$s(A)$**: The signified of the Other, the subject's position in relation to the meaning produced by the Other.

- **$I(A)$**: The Ego Ideal, the point from which the subject is seen as likable by the Other.

- **(D)**: The subject in relation to demand, leading to the Drive.

- **$a$**: *Objet petit a*, the object-cause of desire, linked to jouissance.

<br>

##   Lacan and the [MoÃàbius Strip - Topology, Psychoanalysis]() and Representation

<br>

#### [M√∂bius Strip in Lacan's Psychoanalysis]():

<br>

The M√∂bius strip is a mathematical surface with a half-twist, forming **one continuous side and one boundary**.

<br>

- [**Key property:**](): Traveling on it covers what seem to be ‚Äútwo sides‚Äù without lifting the pen since it really has only one side.

- [**Lacan‚Äôs metaphor:**](): It illustrates how the subject‚Äôs inside and outside, or self and Other, are continuous and intertwined rather than opposed.

- [**Psychoanalytic significance**](): Desire, language, and unconscious processes similarly cross and fold these boundaries, making the psyche a dynamic and paradoxical structure.

- [**Clinical insight**]()(: Symptoms and identifications are points of twist or cut in this continuous flow, and psychoanalysis is a process of traversing and understanding this topology.

## [Lacan and the M√∂bius Strip: Topology, Psychoanalysis, and Representation]()

<br>

### What Is the [M√∂bius Strip]() ?

The **M√∂bius strip** is a topological surface formed by taking a strip of paper, giving it a half-twist, and joining the ends to make a loop. It has the remarkable property of having only _one side_ and _one continuous edge_. If you trace along the surface, you pass ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù without ever crossing an edge, revealing a space where the usual binary oppositions (inside/outside) collapse.

<br>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e83e4c8-2965-473b-9bba-df9294629953" width="325"/>

<br><br>

### [Lacan‚Äôs Use of the M√∂bius Strip in Psychoanalysis]()

<br>

Jacques Lacan employed the M√∂bius strip as a privileged topological metaphor to represent the paradoxical, continuous, and intertwined nature of subjectivity, language, and desire:


<br>

- [**Ambiguity of Inside and Outside**](): The strip illustrates that the subject is not clearly divided between internal (self, unconscious) and external (Other, language, society); these aspects are dynamically continuous, as shown by the single surface of the M√∂bius strip.

<br>

- [**Structure of Desire**](): Desire is conceptualized as an ongoing loop traversing between the subject and the Other, never fixed to one side but constantly moving and folding back on itself, like traveling along the M√∂bius strip‚Äôs twisted surface.

<br>

- [**Unconscious as Language Structure**](): Just as the strip defies simple spatial logic, the unconscious defies the neat inside/outside division. The strip symbolizes how language and subjectivity are folded and inseparable, with ‚Äúsignifier‚Äù and ‚Äúsignified‚Äù linked in a continuous chain.

<br>

- [**Clinical Implications**](): Symptoms and psychic phenomena can be seen as ‚Äútwist points‚Äù or ‚Äúcuts‚Äù on the strip that break but also constitute the continuous flow of signification and desire. The analytic process can be conceptualized as ‚Äútraversing the fantasy,‚Äù moving along the strip beyond fixed identifications.

<br>

- [**Relation to Other Topological Figures**](): Lacan‚Äôs broader topological toolbox includes the torus, Klein bottle, cross-cap, and Borromean knot, each representing other complex structures in psychoanalysis (imaginary, symbolic, real, and their interrelations).

<br>


### - [Representations of the M√∂bius Strip]()

<br>

###  [M√∂bius Strip](): Traversing the Sides of Subjectivity

<br>

[**Clinical Example**]():

A patient insistently oscillates between feeling ‚Äúinside‚Äù (withdrawn, self-absorbed) and ‚Äúoutside‚Äù (dependent or seeking validation). Every time therapy seems to clarify a boundary‚Äîsuch as understanding a symptom as ‚Äúmine‚Äù versus ‚Äúthe Other‚Äôs‚Äù‚Äîthe patient‚Äôs experience slips to the opposite side, as if the distinction melts away.

<br>

- [**Implication**]():
The M√∂bius strip helps the analyst and patient see that psychic boundaries (self/Other, conscious/unconscious) are fundamentally twisted and continuous. Recognizing this can reduce frustration in analytic work and foster acceptance of ambiguity within identity and desire, making the analytic process less about achieving ‚Äúclosure‚Äù and more about navigating complexity.

## [Lacan‚Äôs Topological Figures Beyond the M√∂bius Strip]()


<br><br>


### [1](). Torus

<br>

[**The torus**]() is a surface shaped like a doughnut: a circle rotated around an axis outside itself.

Lacan uses the¬†torus¬†(toro in Portuguese) as an important topological figure in his psychoanalytic theory to represent the structure and dynamics of desire and subjectivity. The torus is a doughnut-shaped surface characterized by its ring form with a central hole, and it symbolizes continuity with a central void that is conceptually linked to Lacan‚Äôs notion of lack or "object a", the unattainable object of desire.

### [Torus](): 

<br>

- [Key points about the torus in Lacan‚Äôs theory]():

  * Continuity and Repetition:¬†The torus illustrates the cyclical, repetitive nature of desire and demand. Desire is not fixed but circulates like movement around the ring of the torus.

  * Central Hole as Lack:¬†The hole in the middle of the torus symbolizes a fundamental void or lack that is the core of subjectivity and desire ‚Äî this lack is what drives the subject‚Äôs continual movement around desire.

  * Relation to Demand and Desire:¬†Lacan used the torus in his seminars, particularly in "Function and Field of Speech and Language" and "The Seminar on Identification," to explain the dynamic relationship between demand (what    is asked from the Other) and desire (what remains unfulfilled and elusive).
 
  * Topological Reversal:¬†In psychoanalytic dynamics, the torus can be ‚Äúturned inside out‚Äù or ‚Äúreversed,‚Äù reflecting phenomena like identification and the shifts in psychic boundaries between inside and outside.

   * Incorporation in Clinical Theory:¬†The torus helps conceptualize how the subject‚Äôs structure is organized around a dynamic of emptiness and repetition, which informs psychoanalytic treatment and interpretation.

> *The torus is depicted as a circular ring, representing a continuous surface with a central hole. In three dimensions, it looks like a doughnut.*

<br>

#### [Lacanian Use]():

- [**Psyche and Repetition**](): The torus shows cyclical structures in the psyche‚Äîrepetition, desire circling a central void (the unattainable object a). It embodies continuity, yet the hole at its center represents the structural lack at the heart of subjectivity.

<br>

#### 2. [Torus](): The Circuit of Repetitive Desire

<br>

[**Clinical Example**]():
A patient repeatedly finds themselves in similar relational patterns‚Äîalways circling back to the ‚Äúsame‚Äù dysfunctional relationship or self-defeating job scenario, despite conscious efforts to change.

<br>

- [**Implication**]():
The torus enables the analyst to conceptualize repetition compulsion not merely as a linear return of the same but as circulation around a structural hole: the *object a* (cause of desire). Analytically, interventions can focus less on content and more on how the repetitive pattern structures the patient‚Äôs world, potentially opening new routes of desire that recognize, rather than deny, lack.

### [2](). Klein Bottle

<br>

[**The Klein bottle**]() is a non-orientable surface with no inside or outside. It cannot be fully represented in three dimensions without self-intersection.

    | |
    | |
```

> *This shows a simplified bottle whose neck curves back into its side, passing "through" the surface (as possible only in four dimensions).*

<br>


#### [Lacanian Use]():

- [**Beyond Distinction:**](): The Klein bottle challenges the division between inside and outside even more radically than the M√∂bius strip. For Lacan, it models the way language and subjectivity suffuse each other, erasing fixed boundaries between self and Other, conscious and unconscious.

### [3](). Borromean Knot

<br>

The [**Borromean knot (or rings)**]() consists of three interlinked rings, no two of which are directly linked; removing one unlinks the rest.

<br>

### [Borromean Knot]():

<br>


```text
    O    O
     \  /
      \/
      /\
     /  \
    O----O
```


> *Each circle is linked with the other two, forming a structure where all are interdependent, yet no pair is directly connected.*

<br>

#### [Lacanian Use]():

- [**Registers of the Psyche:**](): The Borromean knot models the Real, the Symbolic, and the Imaginary‚ÄîLacan‚Äôs three primary registers. The subject‚Äôs coherence depends on the way these link together; if any are cut, psychic coherence collapses. It‚Äôs central in Lacan‚Äôs late work to show the topology of psychic structure and the impact of trauma or symptom.
