## [Overview]():

This repository presents a detailed and interdisciplinary exploration of **Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory**, with a focus on the **Graph of Desire** and associated *mathemes*‚Äîformal symbolic and topological models of unconscious subjectivity and desire.

By bridging psychoanalysis, formal mathematics, and computational modeling (including the Free Energy Principle), it provides theory, visualization, and simulation tools for researchers in **Humanistic AI, cognitive science, linguistics**, and psychoanalysis.


<br>

## Key Concepts

- **Graph of Desire:** A structure showing how unconscious desire traverses and is shaped by language (the signifying chain), symbolic law (the Other), and internal division (the barred subject).
- **Mathemes:** Lacan‚Äôs formal logic of key psychoanalytic notions, like sexuation, subjectivity, and the structure of desire.
- **Symbolic Formalization:** Use of logic, topology, and graph theory to model the dynamics of the unconscious.

## <p align="center"> [ùöø]() Lacan‚Äôs Graph of Desire ‚Äî Mathematical Formalization and the Expression of the Unconscious in Psychoanalytic Theory


<br>

## Overview

This repository offers a deep exploration of **Jacques Lacan‚Äôs psychoanalytic theory**, focusing on the **Graph of Desire** and associated *mathemes*‚Äîformal symbolic and topological representations of unconscious subjectivity and desire.

By linking psychoanalysis with symbolic mathematics and computational frameworks such as the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**, this project bridges psychoanalysis, linguistics, cognitive science, and **Humanistic Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.


<br>


## What‚Äôs Inside

- **LaTeX/TikZ visualizations** of Lacan‚Äôs key graphs, including the Graph of Desire, with elements such as the barred subject ($\$$), Other ($A$), and objet petit a ($a$).
- **Python Jupyter Notebooks** simulating Lacan-inspired dynamics using:
  - **NetworkX** ‚Äî graph nodes and edges visualization
  - **Matplotlib** ‚Äî plotting the vector of desire (horseshoe curve)
  - **SymPy** ‚Äî symbolic logic to express Lacan‚Äôs sexuation mathemes
- Theoretical discussions on:
  - Alienation, truth, and transference
  - Embodiment and unconscious material formalization
  - Relationships between Lacanian theory and computational neuroscience
- Latest research insights formalizing Lacan‚Äôs psychoanalysis with the **Free Energy Principle** approach:
  - Modeling the **Real, Symbolic, Imaginary (RSI)** triad as autonomous, interacting units minimizing free energy
  - Formalizing **desire** as dyadic synchronization of symbolic orders
  - Modeling **the Other** as an emergent triadic collective dynamic
- Educational and research resources for linguists, psychoanalysts, AI researchers, and Humanistic AI data scientists.

## Background on Lacan and Computational Psychoanalysis

**Jacques Lacan‚Äôs Graph of Desire** graphically illustrates the interaction between language (signifying chain), desire, and subjectivity, entwining:

- The **signifying chain** ($S \to S'$), representing linguistic structure
- The **vector of desire**, a horseshoe-shaped curve intersecting the chain
- The **barred subject** ($\$$), or the divided self mediated by language
- The **Other** ($A$), symbolic authority shaping subject formation
- The **objet petit a** ($a$), the elusive cause of desire perpetually sought

Recent computational work (e.g., Heins et al. 2025) embeds these concepts within the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** framework, modeling living and cognitive systems as minimizing prediction error or "free energy."

<br>

This formalization reveals:

- Desire as **generalized synchronization** between subjects‚Äô symbolic orders
- The **incompleteness and instability of the Other**, aligning with Lacan‚Äôs maxim ‚Äúthe Other does not exist‚Äù
- How intersubjectivity and unconscious drives can be simulated as dynamical systems


<br>


## Installation

1. Install Python 3.8+ (Anaconda recommended).  
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib networkx sympy jupyterlab
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Open and run notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory.

## Usage and Examples

### Visualizing Lacan‚Äôs Graph of Desire

- Directed graph of key Lacanian nodes and symbolic edges  
- Horseshoe-shaped vector of desire intersecting the signifying chain  
- Annotation of barred subject, Other, desire point

### Symbolic Formalization

- Logical symbolic formulas representing Lacan‚Äôs sexuation mathemes, e.g.:

  - Masculine sexuation: $$\forall x \neg \Phi(x)$$  
  - Feminine sexuation: $$\neg \exists x \neg \Phi(x)$$

### Computational Psychoanalytic Modeling

- Simulation scripts demonstrating basic dynamics inspired by Lacanian theory and FEP  
- Potential to extend with interactive widgets or agent-based models for deeper research
