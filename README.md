## Overview

This repository offers a deep exploration of **Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalytic theory**, focusing on the **Graph of Desire** and associated *mathemes*—formal symbolic and topological representations of unconscious subjectivity and desire.

By linking psychoanalysis with symbolic mathematics and computational frameworks such as the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**, this project bridges psychoanalysis, linguistics, cognitive science, and **Humanistic Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

## What’s Inside

- **LaTeX/TikZ visualizations** of Lacan’s key graphs, including the Graph of Desire, with elements such as the barred subject ($\$$), Other ($A$), and objet petit a ($a$).
- **Python Jupyter Notebooks** simulating Lacan-inspired dynamics using:
  - **NetworkX** — graph nodes and edges visualization
  - **Matplotlib** — plotting the vector of desire (horseshoe curve)
  - **SymPy** — symbolic logic to express Lacan’s sexuation mathemes
- Theoretical discussions on:
  - Alienation, truth, and transference
  - Embodiment and unconscious material formalization
  - Relationships between Lacanian theory and computational neuroscience
- Latest research insights formalizing Lacan’s psychoanalysis with the **Free Energy Principle** approach:
  - Modeling the **Real, Symbolic, Imaginary (RSI)** triad as autonomous, interacting units minimizing free energy
  - Formalizing **desire** as dyadic synchronization of symbolic orders
  - Modeling **the Other** as an emergent triadic collective dynamic
- Educational and research resources for linguists, psychoanalysts, AI researchers, and Humanistic AI data scientists.

## Background on Lacan and Computational Psychoanalysis

**Jacques Lacan’s Graph of Desire** graphically illustrates the interaction between language (signifying chain), desire, and subjectivity, entwining:

- The **signifying chain** ($S \to S'$), representing linguistic structure
- The **vector of desire**, a horseshoe-shaped curve intersecting the chain
- The **barred subject** ($\$$), or the divided self mediated by language
- The **Other** ($A$), symbolic authority shaping subject formation
- The **objet petit a** ($a$), the elusive cause of desire perpetually sought

Recent computational work (e.g., Heins et al. 2025) embeds these concepts within the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** framework, modeling living and cognitive systems as minimizing prediction error or "free energy."

This formalization reveals:

- Desire as **generalized synchronization** between subjects’ symbolic orders
- The **incompleteness and instability of the Other**, aligning with Lacan’s maxim “the Other does not exist”
- How intersubjectivity and unconscious drives can be simulated as dynamical systems

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.8+ (Anaconda recommended).  
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib networkx sympy jupyterlab
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Open and run notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory.

## Usage and Examples

### Visualizing Lacan’s Graph of Desire

- Directed graph of key Lacanian nodes and symbolic edges  
- Horseshoe-shaped vector of desire intersecting the signifying chain  
- Annotation of barred subject, Other, desire point

### Symbolic Formalization

- Logical symbolic formulas representing Lacan’s sexuation mathemes, e.g.:

  - Masculine sexuation: $$\forall x \neg \Phi(x)$$  
  - Feminine sexuation: $$\neg \exists x \neg \Phi(x)$$

### Computational Psychoanalytic Modeling

- Simulation scripts demonstrating basic dynamics inspired by Lacanian theory and FEP  
- Potential to extend with interactive widgets or agent-based models for deeper research
