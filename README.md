## [Overview]():

This repository presents a detailed and interdisciplinary exploration of **Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory**, with a focus on the **Graph of Desire** and associated *mathemes*‚Äîformal symbolic and topological models of unconscious subjectivity and desire.

By bridging psychoanalysis, formal mathematics, and computational modeling (including the Free Energy Principle), it provides theory, visualization, and simulation tools for researchers in **Humanistic AI, cognitive science, linguistics**, and psychoanalysis.


<br>

## [Key Concepts]()

- **Graph of Desire:** A structure showing how unconscious desire traverses and is shaped by language (the signifying chain), symbolic law (the Other), and internal division (the barred subject).
- **Mathemes:** Lacan‚Äôs formal logic of key psychoanalytic notions, like sexuation, subjectivity, and the structure of desire.
- **Symbolic Formalization:** Use of logic, topology, and graph theory to model the dynamics of the unconscious.

<br>


## [Recent Computational Formalization]()

A recent study ([Heins et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1574650)) **formalizes Lacanian psychoanalysis using the Free Energy Principle (FEP)**, providing computational simulations embodying concepts such as desire, the Other, and their dynamic relations.

<br>

### ‚ö°Ô∏è [Highlights]()

<br>

- Models the Real, Symbolic, and Imaginary (RSI) orders as interacting autonomous systems minimizing free energy.
- Simulates structures like the **Borromean knot**, **dyadic synchronization** (desire as metaphorical convergence), and **triadic collective behaviors** (the Other as emergent).
- Demonstrates that the subject‚Äôs desire is ultimately the *desire of the Other*, and that ‚Äúthe Other does not exist‚Äù; mirroring G√∂delian incompleteness.

***This work connects psychoanalysis, computational neuroscience, and [Humanistic AI](), supporting the rigorous modeling of subjectivity and unconscious processes.***

## [Limits of Formalization: G√∂del‚Äôs Incompleteness Theorems and Lacanian Theory]()

This repository not only formalizes Lacan‚Äôs psychoanalytic theory, but also acknowledges the [**limits of all formal systems**]() as demonstrated by [**G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness theorems**](). No [axiomatic model‚Äîwhether]()  in mathematics, logic, or psychoanalysis‚Äîcan be both complete and consistent. There will always be aspects of [reality]() (the ‚Äúreal‚Äù in Lacanian terms) that escape symbolic capture.

This parallel reinforces Lacan's insight that the unconscious and human subjectivity remain fundamentally open and incomplete, echoing the [**lack in the Other**]()  and the inherent boundaries of any modeling approach‚Äîcritical for anyone working in [Humanistic AI]().


Below, I develop this parallel including the most relevant mathematical formalizations in LaTeX and its relation to Lacanian theory.

<br>

### [1](). G√∂del and the limitations of formalization

G√∂del proved that **no sufficiently powerful formal system** (such as basic arithmetic) can be both *complete* and *consistent*.

<br>

### - [**First Incompleteness Theorem**](): There exist true propositions in arithmetic that can never be proven within the formal system itself.

Mathematically, given a consistent and recursively enumerable formal system $F\$ that includes arithmetic, there is a statement $G_F\$ (called the G√∂del sentence) such that:

<br>

$$
F \not\vdash G_F \quad \text{and} \quad F \not\vdash \neg G_F
$$

<br>

[That is](): neither $G_F\$ nor its negation can be proven in $F\$, rendering $F\$ incomplete.


<br><br>

### <p align="center">  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ãÖ‚ãÜ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ãÜ‚ãÖ[‚úÆ]()‚ãÖ‚ãÜ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ãÖ‚ãÜ ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 

<br><br>


### - [**Second Incompleteness Theorem**](): The system $F\$ cannot prove its own consistency, formally expressed as:

<br>

$$
F \not\vdash \mathrm{Consis}(F)
$$

<br>

[Where](): $\mathrm{Consis}(F)$ is a formula within the system expressing the ‚Äúnon-contradiction‚Äù of $F\$.

<br>

### [2](). Conceptual translation to Lacan and psychoanalysis

The psychoanalytic subject‚Äôs experience, according to Lacan, is marked by a structure of *lack*, which he calls the **‚ÄúReal‚Äù**; a domain resisting full symbolization by the **‚ÄúSymbolic‚Äù** (language and its rules). This Real is precisely what escapes any complete and closed formalization.

- The **‚ÄúOther‚Äù** (in Lacanian theory, the symbolic instance) contains a fundamental *lack*, a kind of **structural incompleteness** that prevents the subject from being perfectly represented or captured in totality.

- Just as G√∂del shows that every formal system has inevitable limits (undemonstrable truths), the Lacanian subject experiences their unconscious as marked by an ‚Äúexcess‚Äù beyond the symbolic, not fully representable or accessible.

<br>

## Overview

This repository offers a deep exploration of **Jacques Lacan‚Äôs psychoanalytic theory**, focusing on the **Graph of Desire** and associated *mathemes*‚Äîformal symbolic and topological representations of unconscious subjectivity and desire.

By linking psychoanalysis with symbolic mathematics and computational frameworks such as the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**, this project bridges psychoanalysis, linguistics, cognitive science, and **Humanistic Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.


<br>


## What‚Äôs Inside

- **LaTeX/TikZ visualizations** of Lacan‚Äôs key graphs, including the Graph of Desire, with elements such as the barred subject ($\$$), Other ($A$), and objet petit a ($a$).
- **Python Jupyter Notebooks** simulating Lacan-inspired dynamics using:
  - **NetworkX** ‚Äî graph nodes and edges visualization
  - **Matplotlib** ‚Äî plotting the vector of desire (horseshoe curve)
  - **SymPy** ‚Äî symbolic logic to express Lacan‚Äôs sexuation mathemes
- Theoretical discussions on:
  - Alienation, truth, and transference
  - Embodiment and unconscious material formalization
  - Relationships between Lacanian theory and computational neuroscience
- Latest research insights formalizing Lacan‚Äôs psychoanalysis with the **Free Energy Principle** approach:
  - Modeling the **Real, Symbolic, Imaginary (RSI)** triad as autonomous, interacting units minimizing free energy
  - Formalizing **desire** as dyadic synchronization of symbolic orders
  - Modeling **the Other** as an emergent triadic collective dynamic
- Educational and research resources for linguists, psychoanalysts, AI researchers, and Humanistic AI data scientists.


  <br>

## Background on Lacan and Computational Psychoanalysis

**Jacques Lacan‚Äôs Graph of Desire** graphically illustrates the interaction between language (signifying chain), desire, and subjectivity, entwining:

- The **signifying chain** ($S \to S'$), representing linguistic structure
- The **vector of desire**, a horseshoe-shaped curve intersecting the chain
- The **barred subject** ($\$$), or the divided self mediated by language
- The **Other** ($A$), symbolic authority shaping subject formation
- The **objet petit a** ($a$), the elusive cause of desire perpetually sought

Recent computational work (e.g., Heins et al. 2025) embeds these concepts within the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** framework, modeling living and cognitive systems as minimizing prediction error or "free energy."

<br>

This formalization reveals:

- Desire as **generalized synchronization** between subjects‚Äô symbolic orders
- The **incompleteness and instability of the Other**, aligning with Lacan‚Äôs maxim ‚Äúthe Other does not exist‚Äù
- How intersubjectivity and unconscious drives can be simulated as dynamical systems


<br>
