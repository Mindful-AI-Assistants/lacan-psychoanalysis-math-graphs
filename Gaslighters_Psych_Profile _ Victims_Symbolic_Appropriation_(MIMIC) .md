# Psychological Profile of Tech Gaslighters and Symbolic Appropriation (MIMIC) of Their Victims

<br>

## Overview

<br><br>

In corporate tech environments, gaslighting extends beyond subtle manipulation. Once a perceived threat is removed, the gaslighter may **mimic and appropriate not only the victim’s work but also their style, communication patterns, and even personality traits**. This behavior, termed **symbolic appropriation (MIMIC)**, effectively erases the victim’s presence and identity while enhancing the gaslighter’s symbolic and social capital.

<br>

> **Important Note:** Gaslighters usually occupy **senior or influential positions**—managers, tech leads, or senior engineers—and their actions primarily target colleagues **below them in hierarchy**. Individuals above them or those they seek to flatter are typically unaffected.

<br><br>

## Step 1: Exclusion of the Victim

Gaslighters often begin by **systematically removing high-performing or innovative colleagues from visibility and influence**. Common tactics include:

- Excluding individuals from key meetings, decisions, or communication channels.  
- Denying access to leadership or high-visibility opportunities.  
- Spreading subtle negative impressions: “hard to work with,” “not a team fit.”  
- Isolating the victim from peers who could act as allies.  


<br>

> **Goal:** Reduce recognition and create a vacuum for the gaslighter to occupy.

<br><br>


## Step 2: Mimicry and Symbolic Appropriation

<br><br>

After exclusion, the gaslighter begins **appropriating the victim’s contributions and identity**, often progressively and subtly.

**Forms of appropriation include:**
- **Professional outputs:** technical solutions, workflows, AI/ML models, scripts.  
- **Work style:** formatting reports, presentations, emails, or documentation; tone and structure.  
- **Personality traits:** mimicking speech patterns, humor, engagement style, or public persona.  
- **Behavioral cues:** gestures, phrasing, ways of interacting, or signature presentation methods.

**Key effect:** The gaslighter appears as the originator of the victim’s ideas and style, while the victim is erased professionally and symbolically.

<br>

> **Hierarchy note:** Targets are typically subordinates or peers. Those above the gaslighter, or whom they seek to flatter, are rarely affected.

<br><br>

## Realistic Examples

**Example 1: Data Science Pipeline**  
- A data scientist proposes a new AI deployment pipeline.  
- Her contributions are dismissed in early meetings.  
- She is excluded from follow-ups.  
- Weeks later, the tech lead presents the same pipeline **in her style and using her phrasing**, claiming credit.



**Example 2: Personality Mimicry**  
- The gaslighter starts using the victim’s expressions, humor, and phrasing in communications and presentations.  
- The team perceives the gaslighter as the originator, further erasing the victim.

<br><br>

## Step 3: Mechanisms Behind MIMIC

1. **Observation:** Mapping victim’s respected traits—technical skills, communication, personality markers.  
2. **Elimination:** Removing the victim from visibility and recognition.  
3. **Adoption:** Gradually incorporating intellectual contributions, style, and personal identity markers.  
4. **Double Harm:**  
   - **Invisibility:** Victim’s originality and identity are erased.  
   - **Symbolic Gain:** Gaslighter strengthens status and influence by impersonating the victim.

## Psychological Profile of the Gaslighter

- **Typical Role:** Senior, influential, or managerial positions with formal or informal authority.  
- **Motivations:**  
  - Protect reputation and status.  
  - Eliminate perceived competition below them.  
  - Control narratives of innovation and performance.  
  - Centralize decision-making power.  

<br>

- **Observed Behaviors:**  
  - Undermining contributions subtly and consistently.  
  - Moving goalposts after deadlines.  
  - Denying prior conversations or instructions.  
  - Taking credit for others’ work.  
  - Ridiculing ideas using technical jargon.  
  - Using indirect communication to confuse or isolate.  
  - Adopting professional and personal traits of excluded colleagues.

## Warning Signs & Red Flags

<br>

- Consistent exclusion from meetings, threads, or decisions.  
- Reappearance of your ideas or outputs as someone else’s.  
- Copying of personal style, tone, humor, or presentation habits.  
- Changing criteria or goals after delivery.  
- Denial of prior conversations, agreements, or instructions.  
- Subtle or repeated discrediting, including technical nitpicking.  
- Confusing or indirect communication to destabilize you.

<br>

> **Tip:** Document all interactions, preserve evidence, and seek support from peers or HR.

<br><br>

## Organizational Impact

- **Culture Damage:** Originality becomes unsafe; innovation is likely to be stolen.  
- **Diversity Erosion:** Unique voices, especially from underrepresented groups, are silenced.  
- **Innovation Stifled:** Fear replaces creativity; only those aligned with or submissive to the gaslighter survive.  
- **Psychological Toll:** Victims may leave burned out or disengaged, while the gaslighter consolidates power.

<br><br>

## Closing Note

<br>

> **Mimicry and symbolic appropriation (MIMIC)** is a potent, often invisible form of gaslighting in tech. It erases **both professional contributions and personality traits**, primarily targeting subordinates, while leaving those above or flattered mostly unaffected. Recognizing MIMIC early is critical to building **healthy, inclusive, and resilient teams**.
